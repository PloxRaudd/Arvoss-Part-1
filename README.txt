  Project creation medium:  Gamemaker Studio 2 (version 2.3)
  
  The project is currently in the planning stages, establishing lists for game assets and background information to aid in consistent worldbuilding.
  
  
  This game is intended to be a large project, not one for jam submissions or significant, short deadlines.  It is a game that *I* want to get marketed,
that *I* want to get sold.  I want to do this because of my circumstances.  I have an alcoholic father-in-law, a mildly overbearing mother who has to put
up with his shit shenanigans that only got significantly worse in the past two months (his shenanigans), a pokey younger brother who's a complete moron 
sometimes, his fiancee, and their cannonball child who's likely a high-functioning autistic.  I want to rescue them from at least one of the problems
that plagues the whole family under this singular roof: money.

  Why do I want to do that and not save myself?  Because I'm the one with the hero complex, and I'm too nice for my own good even if I have the barbed
words of your average everyday asshole.  I talk like this because it's my only way to cope left to me.  So why do I really want to save them from the
issue of financial uncertainty?  Because my father-in-law doesn't care about who else he drags down into the hole with his shit, my brother pines for
being a comedian before he thinks about the pragmatism of financial security, my brother's fiancee does nothing at all, and my mother is mostly 
invalid due to fibromyalgia.  This leaves the burden of thinking about the future of the place I'm in to me alone, for their sakes.

  Funny, I didn't expect this to be a personal outpouring journal at the time being.  But, I might as well leave this here until a time when I don't
need to look back on it anymore.  So for anyone else who sees all this, I want you to remember this:
      "For every hundred-thousand people who complain about their lot, there will be one person who fights to change that. They might never be
	satisfied, but that person is who the horizon is for. The unknown that everyone else fears? That is where you will find that one, if you ever
	find them.  We call them heroes.  You call them strangers, adventurers, unknowns; Or, quite possibly worse, demons.  They have seen and been
	where you don't and won't."
